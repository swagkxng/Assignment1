    <h2>My Personality</h2>
    <p>According to my personality test, I am <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Logistician</strong>.</p>
    <img src="Assets/images/personality_test.png" alt="Personality Test Screenshot">

    <p>I pride myself in being well-organized and dependable; hence, my full strength in academic life is my professionalism to work and see that everything that is assigned will be done in the best way. I am selective about details, and it is something positive for me because I am never late, always remember the deadlines, keep my work quality high, and error-free. This approach makes me an efficient student and allows me to meet the challenges of doing complex work while bearing in mind the pressure that comes with that.</p>

    <p><strong>Sensing:</strong> This makes me functional because it relays calmness during the most tension-filled academic times. However, this sometimes limits my ability to understand and lend myself emotionally to a group project as I might with the rest of the group. Nevertheless, commitment and hard work make me stand out as a responsible team member. While I sometimes only give lip service to the no use of keywords, I further support this by being more responsible and orderly, especially when it comes to handling group works.</p>

    <p>In sum, I think that this personality test is valid, accurately depicting me in a true sense. It particularly reflects how organizations I need in school. I do concur with its evaluation of my difficulties, which include when it comes to exhibiting feelings, though on noting my concerns in school life, I would like to think that my tenacity and concentration outweigh every prospect of drawback.</p>

    <h2>My Hero</h2>
    <div class="hero-container">
        <img src="Assets/images/Sung-jin-woo.png" alt="Sung Jin-Woo">
        <div>
            <p><strong>Sung Jin-Woo</strong> is my hero because he exemplifies growth, determination, and the will to overcome any obstacle. Starting as an E-rank hunter, he faced insurmountable challenges but never backed down. Through sheer grit and hard work, he transformed into one of the strongest hunters, showcasing that perseverance and dedication can lead to extraordinary results. His journey motivates me to continuously strive for improvement and to believe in my potential, no matter the odds.</p>
